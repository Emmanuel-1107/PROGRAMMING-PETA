        <span class="colo-content"><b>The Colosseum</b> (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) 
            is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, 
            just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever 
            built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite 
            its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 
            72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).
             Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). 
            The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian 
            dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
             Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo])
             by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
            <BR> <BR> <BR> 
            The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock),
             and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 
            spectators at various points in its history, having an average 
            audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public 
            spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, 
            and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building 
            ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused 
            for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress,
             a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

        <span class="colo-content"><h1>NAME</h1><BR>Originally, the building's Latin name was simply <b>amphitheatrum</b>,
            'amphitheatre'. Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium) 
           is often used, there is no evidence it was used in classical antiquity. This name refers to
            the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building was constructed, but 
           the structure is better known as the Colosseum.In antiquity, Romans may have referred to
            the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective
            pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it
            was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also 
           constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).
           <BR> <BR> <BR>
           The name "Colosseum" is thought to have originated from a colossal 
           statue of Nero, reminiscent of the Colossus of Rhodes. Emperor Hadrian
            positioned this statue beside the amphitheater. "Colosseum" is derived
            from the Latin adjective "colosseus," meaning gigantic. By 1000 AD, 
           "Colosseum" referred to the amphitheater due to its proximity to the 
           "Colossus Solis." Variations in spelling like "coloseum" and "coliseum" 
           emerged in Medieval Latin. In the 12th century, it was called "amphitheatrum
            colisei." In the High Middle Ages, it was referred to as "colosé" in 
           Old French and "colisée" in Middle French. Middle English had "colisee," 
           used by John Capgrave in the 15th century. Translations of Marcus Aurelius' 
           biography mentioned "Collisee." The Italian "colosseo" referred to the Roman 
           amphitheater and later any amphitheater. Other languages, such as Catalan, 
           Spanish, and Portuguese, adopted similar terms by the 15th and 16th centuries.

        <span class="colo-content-2">The Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a 
            variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always 
            given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong 
            religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige 
            and were immensely popular. Another major attraction was the animal hunt,
             or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported 
            from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, 
            hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, 
            leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts
             were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. 
            These events could be huge in scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his
             victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000
             gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad 
            bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, 
            naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them 
            to pieces. Acrobats and magicians would also perform, usually during the intervals.</span>

    <div class="colo-info-2r">
        <span class="colo-content-2r">During the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded 
            that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as 
            navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural
             games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for 
            a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also 
            an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean
             (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some 
            debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been 
            a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor
             would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move 
            around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location 
            wrong or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel 
            down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).
            <BR> <BR>
            Sylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. 
            Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a 
            forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and 
            animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to 
            display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise 
            be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. 
            They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story – 
            played by a condemned person – was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically 
            authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.
