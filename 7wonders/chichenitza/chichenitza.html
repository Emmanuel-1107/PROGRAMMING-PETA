                <span class="chichen-info"><b>Chichén Itzá</b>(often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) 
                    was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. 
                    The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late 
                    Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the 
                    early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude 
                    of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc 
                    and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles 
                    was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from 
                    central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya 
                    styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of 
                    the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.
                    The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could
                     have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship 
                    is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia 
                    (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments 
                    had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    Chichén Itzá is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.</span>

                        The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run 
                        underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that 
                        could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive 
                        for settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or "Sacred Cenote" 
                        (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most 
                        famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under
                         the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists.
                        <BR> <BR> 
                        According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian 
                        Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship 
                        to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado 
                        from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, 
                        as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado
                         found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.</span>

                        of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed 
                        after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional 
                        capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with 
                        its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The 
                        earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, 
                        while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.
                        <BR> <BR> <BR>
                        <h2>Establishment</h2>
                        The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc 
                        cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying
                         the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.
                        <BR> <BR> <BR>
                        <h2>Ascendancy</h2>
                        Chichén Itzá rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early 
                        Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, toward the end of 
                        the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that
                         the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating 
                        political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern
                         Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and
                         fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.
                        <BR> <BR> <BR>
                        As Chichén Itzá rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) 
                        and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been
                         mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th 
                        century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna,
                         and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.</span></p>

                            different Mayan Archaeological sites. This one is one of the oldest 
                           Tzompantli found ever. Habitants of Chichen Itza would gather long wooden 
                           beams in which they would hang their enemies' heads. Archaeologists have 
                           found buried figures of Chaac Mool in the Tzompantli of Chichen Itza, along 
                           skull offerings and a broken ring from the Ball Game court.
                           <BR> <BR>
                           The first and most prominent example is the Hueyi Tzompantli (Great Skull-rack) 
                           located in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and described by the early conquistadors. 
                           There were at least five more skull racks in Tenochtitlan but by all accounts they were much smaller.

                           A “T” shaped structure holds skull decorated panels. On the sides you can
                            find skull embossments. In total, over 500 bas-relief skulls have been found on the walls.
                           The Tzompantli of Chichen Itza is a great rectangular platform of 60 meters
                            (197 feet) ong by 12 meters (39 feet) wide. It consists of a very small slope
                            at the bottom, a central band decorated with skulls running in three horizontal 
                           rows, and at the top, a slightly tapered band with another row of skulls.
