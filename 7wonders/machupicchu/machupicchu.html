            <span class="machu-info">Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera 
                of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred 
                to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. 
                It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred 
                Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past 
                it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. 
                In reference to the site's name, for most English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in 
                Picchu is silent. In English, the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/ MAH-choo PEE-choo or /ˌmætʃuː 
                ˈpiːktʃuː/ MATCH-oo PEAK-choo, in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu], and 
                in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].
                <BR> <BR>
                The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first encounter by 
                the Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are recorded to have visited the 
                site from the late 16th century until the 19th century. As far as historical knowledge 
                extends, there are no existing written records detailing the site during its period of 
                active use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants, are 
                the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the 
                site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. 
                Its three primary structures are the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, 
                and the Intihuatana. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to 
                give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 1976, 30 percent of 
                Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues. Most recent archaeologists 
                believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti 
                (1438–1472). The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at 
                the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied 
                from c. 1420–1532. Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably
                 called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.
                <BR> <BR>
                Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO 
                World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New 
                Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.</span>

            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <span class="machu-info-1">Machu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology 
                at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s. However, a 2021 study led by 
                Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have 
                been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD. Construction appears to date from two 
                great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).
                <br> <br>
                A consensus among archaeologists is that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal 
                estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although 
                Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the 
                line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because
                 of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire. It is possible that most of 
                its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors 
                even arrived in the area.</span>

            <h1>CONSTRUCTION</h1>
            <span class="machu-info-2">The central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished 
                dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called 
                ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.
                <BR> <BR>
                The site itself may have been intentionally built on fault lines to afford better
                 drainage and a ready supply of fractured stone. "Machu Picchu clearly shows us 
                that the Incan civilization was an empire of fractured rocks".
                <BR> <BR>
                The section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various 
                challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic 
                activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly 
                useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from some quarries at the site,[104] including 
                one recently discovered using remote sensing techniques, which was probably located in 
                the catchment area between the Hurin and Hanan before it was covered over to create the
                 current Plaza Principal. Once mined the granite stones, the Inca lined them up and 
                shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many 
                stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners 
                usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners 
                were often tied together by L-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.</span>
