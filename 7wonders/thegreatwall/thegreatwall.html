        <p><h1>The Great Wall of China</h1> (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is
             a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese
             states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the
             7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor 
             of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on,  many successive dynasties builtand maintained multiple stretches of border walls. 
             The best-known sections of  the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
            <BR> <BR> <BR>

             Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of 
            duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration
             and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of 
            watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the 
            fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
            <BR> <BR> <BR>

            The frontier walls built by different dynasties have  multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong
             in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day  Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the 
            south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in 
            total. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>

                    While portions north of Beijing and near tourist
                    centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, 
                    in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall 
                    sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and 
                    roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti 
                    and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold 
                    on the market for up to 50 renminbi.<BR>
                    Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.
                    
                    A 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration 
                    states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 
                    1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was 
                    estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu 
                    province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from 
                    sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced
                     from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various
                     square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of
                     the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are 
                    constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more 
                    susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the 
                    border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.
                    
                    A section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in
                     2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the
                     wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police
                     described the act as causing "irreversible damage to the integrity 
                    of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics"
