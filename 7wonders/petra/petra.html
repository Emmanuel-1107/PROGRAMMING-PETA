                    <span>Petra, known in Arabic as ٱلْبَتْراء (Al-Batrāʾ) and in Greek as Πέτρα (Petra), 
                    originally referred to by its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, stands as a 
                    significant historic and archaeological city nestled in southern Jordan. 
                    Renowned for its impressive rock-cut architecture and intricate water conduit 
                    system, Petra earned the moniker of the "Rose City" owing to the hues of the 
                    sandstone from which it was sculpted. Immortalized in a 1845 poem by John Burgon 
                    as "a rose-red city half as old as time," Petra lies adjacent to the majestic 
                    mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, situated within a basin encircled by mountains 
                    delineating the eastern border of the Arabah valley stretching from the Dead Sea 
                    to the Gulf of Aqaba. Access to this remarkable city is facilitated by traversing 
                    the famed and picturesque 1.2-kilometer-long (3⁄4 mile) gorge known as the Siq, leading directly to the Khazneh.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    The region surrounding Petra has been inhabited since as early as 7000 BC, with 
                    evidence suggesting that the Nabataeans possibly settled in the area by the 4th 
                    century BC, ultimately establishing it as the capital of their kingdom. 
                    Archaeological excavations have unearthed traces of Nabataean presence dating back to the 
                    second century BC, signifying Petra's pivotal role in the region's history. As 
                    nomadic Arabs, the Nabataeans capitalized on Petra's strategic location along 
                    incense trade routes, transforming it into a thriving commercial hub.
                    <BR> <BR>
                    Their astute business ventures bolstered their prosperity, with Petra emerging 
                    as the epicenter of their wealth. Proficient in navigating the arid desert terrain, 
                    the Nabataeans adeptly utilized the mountainous landscape to fortify their city 
                    against adversaries. Their expertise in water harvesting, agriculture, and stone 
                    carving enabled them to thrive in this challenging environment. Petra reached its 
                    zenith in the 1st century AD, marked by the construction of Al-Khazneh, believed 
                    to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, and a peak population estimated 
                    at 20,000 inhabitants. Employing an intricate network of cisterns, channels, and 
                    dams, they effectively harnessed rainwater, sustaining their flourishing civilization.
                    While many renowned rock-cut structures, predominantly tombs, originate from this 
                    era and subsequent periods, fewer remnants remain of the city's freestanding edifices.</span>

                        <span id="info-2">While the Nabataean kingdom became a vassal state of the Roman Empire 
                            during the first century BC, it wasn't until 106 AD that it forfeited its 
                            sovereignty entirely. Subsequently, Petra succumbed to Roman rule, leading 
                            to the annexation of Nabataea and its renaming as Arabia Petraea. The city's 
                            prominence waned with the emergence of maritime trade routes, compounded by 
                            the devastation caused by an earthquake in 363 that ravaged many of its structures. 
                            Despite the construction of several Christian churches during the Byzantine era, Petra's 
                            decline persisted, eventually resulting in its abandonment save for a few nomadic inhabitants
                             by the early Islamic period. Its existence remained concealed from the Western world until 
                            1812, when Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt chanced upon its rediscovery.

                            Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra has garnered acclaim as 
                            "one of the most invaluable cultural assets of humanity." Recognized as one of the 
                            <b>New 7 Wonders of the World</b> in 2007, Petra stands as an emblem of Jordan and serves 
                            as the country's premier tourist destination. Tourist arrivals reached a zenith of 
                            1.1 million in 2019, marking the first instance of figures surpassing the million 
                            mark. However, tourism in this historic city experienced a setback due to the COVID-19 
                            pandemic, though it began to rebound shortly thereafter, with visitor numbers reaching 905,000 in 2022.

                            of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn
                             due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, 
                            is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, 
                            which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic
                             architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are 
                            the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as 
                            much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, 
                            and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.

                            In 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones 
                            discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure
                             whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the 
                            time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. 
                            It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal 
                            an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is 
                            facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to
                             it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, 
                            with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform 
                            enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small 
                            building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward 
                            the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery
                             complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a 
                            speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.</span>
