                        <span>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"), 
                            originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō is a historic and 
                            archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its 
                            rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is 
                            also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the 
                            sandstone from which it is carved; it was famously 
                            called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a poem of 
                            1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal 
                            Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the
                             eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead 
                            Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through 
                            a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge 
                            called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.

                            The area around Petra has been inhabited from as 
                            early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have 
                            settled in what would become the capital city of their
                             kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological 
                            work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence 
                            dating back to the second century BC, by which time
                             Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were
                             nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the 
                            incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
                            <BR> <BR> <BR>
                              The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable 
                             revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike 
                              their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in 
                             the barren deserts and were able to repel attacks by taking 
                             advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly 
                             skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture, and stone carving. 
                             Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure,
                             possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed,
                            and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.
                             They developed a complex system of cisterns, channels, and dams to
                             collect and store rainwater, allowing them to thrive in the arid 
                             desert environment. Most of the famous rock-cut buildings, which 
                            are mainly tombs, date from this and the following period. Much
                              less remains of the free-standing buildings of the city.</span>

                            Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106 AD that it
                            lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed 
                           Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance 
                           declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake 
                           in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several
                            Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline
                            and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a 
                           handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 
                           1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.

                           It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has 
                           described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties
                            of man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Petra was voted one of the
                            New 7 Wonders of the World. <strong>Petra is a symbol of Jordan</strong>, as
                            well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers
                            peaked at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure
                            rose above the 1 million mark. Tourism in the historical city was hit
                            hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again, 
                           reaching 905,000 visitors in 2022.</span>

                            of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn
                             due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, 
                            is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, 
                            which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic
                             architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are 
                            the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as 
                            much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, 
                            and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.

                            In 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones 
                            discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure
                             whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the 
                            time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. 
                            It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal 
                            an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is 
                            facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to
                             it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, 
                            with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform 
                            enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small 
                            building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward 
                            the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery
                             complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a 
                            speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.</span>
