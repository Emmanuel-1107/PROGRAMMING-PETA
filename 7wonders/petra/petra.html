                        <span>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"), 
                            originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō is a historic and 
                            archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its 
                            rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is 
                            also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the 
                            sandstone from which it is carved; it was famously 
                            called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a poem of 
                            1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal 
                            Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the
                             eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead 
                            Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through 
                            a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge 
                            called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.

                            The area around Petra has been inhabited from as 
                            early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have 
                            settled in what would become the capital city of their
                             kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological 
                            work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence 
                            dating back to the second century BC, by which time
                             Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were
                             nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the 
                            incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

                              The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable 
                             revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike 
                              their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in 
                             the barren deserts and were able to repel attacks by taking 
                             advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly 
                             skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture, and stone carving. 
                             Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure,
                             possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed,
                            and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.
                             They developed a complex system of cisterns, channels, and dams to
                             collect and store rainwater, allowing them to thrive in the arid 
                             desert environment. Most of the famous rock-cut buildings, which 
                            are mainly tombs, date from this and the following period. Much
                              less remains of the free-standing buildings of the city.</span>
