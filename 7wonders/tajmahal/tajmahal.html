        <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="taj-container">
        <span class="taj-info">The Taj Mahal, known as the "Crown of the Palace," stands as an ivory-white
            marble mausoleum situated on the right bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar
            Pradesh, India. Its construction was initiated in 1631 under the direction of 
           the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigning from 1628 to 1658), to serve as 
           the final resting place for his cherished wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Additionally, it
            encompasses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Occupying a sprawling 17-hectare 
           (42-acre) complex, the mausoleum is complemented by a mosque, a guest house, 
           and meticulously manicured gardens enclosed by a crenellated wall on three sides.
           <BR> <BR>
           Though the construction of the mausoleum concluded in 1648, further enhancements 
           and additions to the complex continued for an additional five years. The inaugural 
           ceremony took place on February 6, 1643, when Shah Jahan commemorated the 12th 
           anniversary of Mumtaz Mahal's passing. The entire Taj Mahal complex is believed 
           to have been finalized by 1653, with estimated costs at the time totaling around 
           ₹5 million, equivalent to approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million) in 2023.
           <BR> <BR>
           Drawing from Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles, the Taj Mahal exemplifies
            symmetrical design principles, incorporating a variety of shapes and symbolic elements.
            While the mausoleum itself is crafted from white marble adorned with semi-precious stones, 
           red sandstone was utilized for the construction of auxiliary buildings, reminiscent of Mughal
            structures from the era. Over 20,000 workers and artisans, overseen by a team of architects 
           led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect, contributed to the project's realization.
           <BR> <BR>
           Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the Taj Mahal is celebrated as a 
           pinnacle of Islamic art in India and revered as one of the world's most treasured 
           masterpieces. It stands as a quintessential example of Mughal architecture and serves 
           as a poignant symbol of Indian history. Drawing millions of visitors annually, it was 
           honored as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007.</span>

        <h1>INSPIRATION</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="taj-container-1">
        <span class="taj-info-1">The Taj Mahal's construction was initiated by Shah Jahan in 1631, in memory of
            his late wife Mumtaz Mahal, who tragically passed away on June 17th of that 
           year while delivering their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Commencing in 1632, the
            construction concluded in 1648, with the additional completion of the surrounding
            structures and gardens five years later. Records from the imperial court depict
            Shah Jahan's profound grief following Mumtaz Mahal's demise, underscoring the 
           poignant love story that inspired the creation of the Taj Mahal.
           <BR> <BR>
           As per contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori, and 
           Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, Shah Jahan's affection for Mumtaz was unparalleled, not 
           matched in his relationships with others. Following her passing, he withdrew 
           from royal duties for a week, consumed by sorrow, and abstained from indulgences
            such as music and opulent attire for a period of two years. Captivated by the 
           beauty of the land south of Agra, where a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I 
           once stood, Shah Jahan selected this site for Mumtaz's tomb after securing Jai
            Singh's donation of the property to the emperor.</span>

        <span class="taj-info-2">The plot of land where the Taj Mahal now stands, located south of the 
            fortified city of Agra, was bestowed upon Shah Jahan by Maharaja Jai Singh 
            I, who exchanged it for a grand palace situated in the heart of Agra. 
            Commissioned in 1631, construction commenced a year later in 1632. A section of approximately
             1.2 hectares (3 acres) underwent excavation, then filled with soil to mitigate 
            seepage and leveled to an elevation of 50 meters (160 ft) above the riverbank. 
            Piles were driven into the ground within the tomb area and packed with lime and 
            stone to serve as the foundation. The elevated platform was subsequently constructed
             using brick and mortar.
            <BR> <BR>
            Primarily constructed using brick and lime mortar, the tomb complex features an 
            exterior surface of the main tomb structure and the interior of the primary cenotaph 
            chamber adorned with white marble veneer. Red sandstone, coated with a red octet for 
            preservation, lines the interior surfaces of other structures and accessory buildings, 
            excluding the dome exteriors. The white marble was sourced from Makrana in Rajasthan, 
            while the red sandstone was quarried from Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh. A diverse array 
            of precious and semi-precious stones, including jade, crystal, turquoise, Lapis lazuli, 
            sapphire, and carnelian, were imported from various regions worldwide for decorative 
            purposes. In total, 28 different types of precious and semi-precious stones were intricately inlaid into the white marble.</span>
