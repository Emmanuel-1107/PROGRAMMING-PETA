            <span class="c-info">The Christ the Redeemer statue, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is an Art Deco 
                representation of Jesus Christ.<BR>It was designed by French-Polish sculptor Paul 
                Landowski and constructed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, who worked 
                with French engineer Albert Caquot. The face was created by Gheorghe Leonida, a 
                Romanian sculptor. Built between 1922 and 1931, the statue stands thirty meters 
                (98 feet) tall without the eight meters (26 feet) that make up its pedestal. Its 
                arms span a distance of 28 meters (92 feet) and are composed of soapstone and reinforced concrete.
                <BR> <BR>
                Situated at the summit of the 700-meter (2,300-foot) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park, 
                with a commanding view of Rio de Janeiro, the statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons). 
                Known as a symbol of Christianity worldwide, the monument is the largest sculpture in the world in the 
                Art Deco style. It has also become a cultural landmark of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was selected as 
                one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.</span>

        <span class="c-info-1">In the mid-1850s, Pedro Maria Boss, a Vincentian priest, proposed the placement of a Christian 
            monument atop Mount Corcovado in honor of Princess Isabel, the daughter of Emperor Pedro II and 
            regent of Brazil. However, the project was not approved. After the country became a republic in 
            1889, the proposed statue was abandoned due to the separation of church and state.
            <BR> <BR>
            In 1920, the Catholic Circle of Rio proposed a second time for a famous statue to be erected atop the 
            mountain. To raise money and gather signatures in favor of the statue's construction, the group planned 
            Semana do Monumento, or "Monument Week." What the group saw as "Godlessness" in society served as their 
            driving force. The majority of the donations were made by Catholics in Brazil. Among the designs that 
            were taken into consideration for the "Statue of the Christ" were those of the Christian cross, Jesus 
            holding a globe, and a pedestal representing the world. Ultimately, the statue of Christ the Redeemer 
            with open arms—a symbol of peace—was selected.
